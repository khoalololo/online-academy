## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* PostgreSQL database (or Supabase account)
* npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd online-academy
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup

#### Option A: Use Supabase (Recommended)

1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Get your connection details from Project Settings > Database
4. Update `ultis/db.js` with your credentials:

```js
const db = knex({
  client: 'pg',
  connection: {
    host: 'your-project.supabase.co',
    port: 5432,
    user: 'postgres',
    password: 'your-password',
    database: 'postgres'
  }
});
```

#### Option B: Local PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Create a new database
3. Update connection details in `ultis/db.js`

### 4. Import Database Schema

Use the provided `DB_SCHEMA.md` to create tables.

```sql
-- See DB_SCHEMA.md for full schema
```

### 5. Generate Admin Password Hash

```bash
node _generateHash.js
```

### 6. Email Configuration

The project uses Ethereal Email for development. Credentials are shown in the console when sending emails.
For production, update `emailService.js` with real SMTP credentials.

### 7. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev   # Development mode
npm start     # Production mode
```

App runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
